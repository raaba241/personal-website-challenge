          <p>
            I went to Carleton for Financial Economics and Mathematics. During
            Covid I had a growing realization that I was very much into
            technology and would like to spend my life immersed in this world. I
            am very competitively driven and I have competed at the highest
            levels of Valorant/CsGo (Rank 300 North America) , I also love speed
            cubing, watching anime , building PCs, making random arduino
            projects, lifting weights, and running long distance. My music taste
            is all over the place, I am 24 and this is hopefully the start of my
            professional career.
